Java defines eight primitive data types, each with a specific size and range:

byte: 8 bits, range from -128 to 127
short: 16 bits, range from -32,768 to 32,767
int: 32 bits, range from -2^31 to 2^31-1
long: 64 bits, range from -2^63 to 2^63-1
float: 32 bits, single-precision floating point
double: 64 bits, double-precision floating point
char: 16 bits, represents a single 16-bit Unicode character
boolean: not precisely defined, but typically 1 bit (true or false)



Memory Efficiency and Performance
The choice of primitive data types can significantly impact the memory efficiency of a Java application. 
For instance, using a byte instead of an int can save memory when dealing with large arrays of small numbers. 
However, it is essential to consider the overhead associated with object creation in Java. 
Each object in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has a metadata overhead,
which can lead to increased memory consumption when using objects instead of primitives.

Example of Memory Overhead
For example, consider an array of Complex objects:

Each Complex object contains two double values (64 bits each) and an object header.
The object header typically requires 32 bits for the class reference.
Therefore, each Complex object consumes 8 bytes of data plus 4 bytes of overhead.
When creating an array of 10 Complex objects, the total memory consumption would be:

Data: 10 objects * (8 bytes + 4 bytes) = 120 bytes
Overhead: 88 bytes for the object header and references
Total: 208 bytes
This example illustrates how the choice of data types and the structure of arrays can lead to significant memory overhead, especially when dealing with numerous small objects.
