/**
 * When you execute the line `String s4 = new String("Gaurav").intern();`, let's break down what
 * happens:
 *
 * <p>1. The string literal `"Gaurav"` is automatically interned when the class containing this code
 * is loaded by the JVM. 2. The `new String("Gaurav")` creates a new `String` object on the heap,
 * with its internal character array containing a copy of the interned string `"Gaurav"`. 3. The
 * `intern()` method checks whether the string `"Gaurav"` is already in the string pool. Since it is
 * (due to step 1), it returns a reference to the existing interned string. 4. The reference
 * returned by `intern()` is assigned to `s4`.
 *
 * <p>In summary, only one additional object is created explicitly on the heap (the `new
 * String("Gaurav")`), but the interned string `"Gaurav"` was already present in the string pool. So
 * the net effect is **one additional object** created by this line of code. ðŸ˜Š
