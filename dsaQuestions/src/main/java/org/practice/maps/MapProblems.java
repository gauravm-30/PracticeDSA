* Certainly! Let's explore the differences between **HashMap**, **TreeMap**, and **LinkedHashMap** in Java:

1. **HashMap**:
   - Offers O(1) lookup and insertion time complexity.
   - The ordering of keys is essentially arbitrary when iterating through them.
   - Implemented using an array of linked lists.
   - Contains values based on keys.
   - Allows only unique elements.
   - May have one null key and multiple null values.
   - Maintains no specific orderÂ¹.

2. **LinkedHashMap**:
   - Also offers O(1) lookup and insertion time complexity.
   - Orders keys based on their insertion order.
   - Implemented using doubly-linked buckets.
   - Contains values based on keys.
   - Allows only unique elements.
   - May have one null key and multiple null values.
   - Maintains the insertion orderÂ¹.

3. **TreeMap**:
   - Offers O(log N) lookup and insertion time complexity.
   - Orders keys, allowing iteration in sorted order.
   - Requires keys to implement the `Comparable` interface.
   - Implemented using a Red-Black Tree.
   - Contains values based on keys.
   - Allows only unique elements.
   - First entry (key, value) can have a null key, but subsequent keys cannot be null.
   - Maintains ascending orderÂ¹.

In summary:
- **HashMap** has fast lookups but no specific key order.
- **LinkedHashMap** maintains insertion order.
- **TreeMap** provides sorted keys based on natural order.
