# **Natural Numbers**

Natural numbers are also called “counting numbers” which contains the set of positive integers from 1 to infinity. The set of natural numbers is represented by the letter “N”. The natural number set is defined by:

N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}

Examples: 35, 59, 110, etc.

# **Whole Numbers**

Whole numbers are also known as natural numbers with zero. The set consists of non-negative integers where it does not contain any decimal or fractional part. The whole number set is represented by the letter “W”. The natural number set is defined by:

W = {0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}

Examples: 67, 0, 49, 52, etc.

# **Integers**

Integers are defined as the set of all whole numbers with a negative set of natural numbers. The integer set is represented by the symbol “Z”. The set of integers is defined as:

Z =  {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}

Examples: -52, 0, -1, 16, 82, etc.

# **Real Numbers**

Any number such as positive integers, negative integers, fractional numbers or decimal numbers without imaginary numbers are called the real numbers. It is represented by the letter “R”.

Examples: ¾, 0.333, √2, 0, -10, 20, etc.

# **Rational Numbers**

Any number that can be written in the form of p/q, i.e., a ratio of one number over another number is known as rational numbers. A rational number can be represented by the letter “Q”.

Examples: 7/1, 10/2, 1/1, 0/1, etc.

# **Irrational Numbers**

The number that cannot be expressed in the form of p/q. It means a number that cannot be written as the ratio of one over another is known as irrational numbers. It is represented by the letter ”P”.

Examples: √2, π, Euler’s constant, etc


# **Some More Types of Numbers**

### **Prime Numbers**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors
other than 1 and itself.
Means Prime numbers are always positive.
These numbers cannot be written as the product of _**two smaller natural**_ numbers.

### **Composite Number**

The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers.
These number can be written as product of two smaller natural numbers.


**Note :** 1 is neither composite nor prime number.


**Note :** 0 is neither positive nor negative number.
