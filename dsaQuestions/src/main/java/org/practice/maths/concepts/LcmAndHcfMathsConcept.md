# **HCF**

The full form of HCF in Maths is **Highest Common Factor.**

As the rules of mathematics dictate, **the greatest common divisor or the gcd** of two or more positive integers happens to be the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, take 8 and 12. The H.C.F. of 8 and 12 will be 4 because the highest number that can divide both 8 and 12 is 4.


# **LCM** 

The full form of LCM in Maths is **Least Common Multiple**.

In arithmetic, the least common multiple or LCM of two numbers say a and b, is denoted as LCM (a,b). And the LCM is the smallest or least positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. For example, let us take two positive integers 4 and 6.

Multiples of 4 are: 4,8,12,16,20,24…

Multiples of 6 are: 6,12,18,24….

The common multiples for 4 and 6 are 12,24,36,48…and so on. The least common multiple in that lot would be 12.

# **HCF and LCM Formula**

The formula which involves both HCF and LCM is:

Product of Two numbers = (HCF of the two numbers) x (LCM of the two numbers)
Say, A and B are the two numbers, then as per the formula;
**A x B = H.C.F.(A, B) x L.C.M.(A, B)**

# **How to find HCF and LCM?**

Here are the methods we can use to find the HCF and LCM of given numbers.

1. Prime factorization method
2. Division method

Let us learn both methods, one by one.

## **HCF by Prime Factorization Method**

Take an example of finding the highest common factor of 144, 104 and 160.
Now let us write the prime factors of 144, 104 and 160.

144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3

104 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 13

160 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5

The common factors of 144, 104 and 160 are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
Therefore, HCF (144, 104, 160) = 8


# **HCF by Division Method**

Steps to find the HCF of any given numbers;

1) Larger number/ Smaller Number
2) The divisor of the above step / Remainder
3) The divisor of step 2 / remainder. Keep doing this step till R = 0(Zero).
4) The last step’s divisor will be HCF.
   The above steps can also be used to find the HCF of more than 3 numbers.
   
5) Example: Find the HCF of 144 and 160 by division method.
   Since 160>144, so the dividend will be 160 and the divisor will be 144.
   By using the division method, we get:
   **HCF by Long division method**

Hence, we can see here that 16 is the highest number which divides 160 and 144.
Therefore, HCF (144, 160) = 16

# **LCM by Prime Factorization Method**

To calculate the LCM of two numbers 60 and 45. Out of other ways, one way to find the LCM of given numbers is as below:

List the prime factors of each number first.
60 = 2 × 2 x 3 × 5
45 = 3 × 3 × 5
Then multiply each factor the most number of times it occurs in any number.
If the same multiple occurs more than once in both the given numbers, then multiply the factor by the most number of times it occurs.
The occurrence of Numbers in the above example:

2: two times

3: two times

5: one time

LCM = 2 × 2 x 3 × 3 × 5 = 180

# **LCM by Division Method**

Let us see with the same example, which we used to find the LCM using prime factorization.
Solve LCM of (60,45) by division method.
LCM by long division method

Therefore, LCM of 60 and 45 = 2 × 2 x 3 × 3 × 5 = 180
